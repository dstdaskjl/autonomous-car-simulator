# Obstacle Avoidance Simulator
This is an autonomous obstacle avoidance car simulator built on Kivy. The model is based on Freenove 4WD Smart Car.
The 3x3 obstacles are randomly generated in the arena, but the number and size of the obstacles can be changed easily.
"obstacle.txt" can be used to spawn obstacles at specific locations.
